# Extra font lock rules for a more colourful dired

This is adapted from the extra font lock rules provided by Drew Adams'
`dired+` package, but published via a modern means, and with support
for older Emacsen removed.

## Installation

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `diredfl` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of `diredfl` there
will always be up-to-date.

Enable `diredfl-mode` in all `dired-mode` buffers by calling or
customising `diredfl-global-mode` as desired.
